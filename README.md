<h2>How I Tested These SARMs</h2>
<p>I ran each compound for 6‚Äì8 weeks. Same gym schedule. Same macros. I tracked:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Body fat % (measured weekly)</li>
  <li>Muscle gain or loss</li>
  <li>Endurance and sleep quality</li>
  <li>Suppression and side effects</li>
</ul>
<p>I used high-purity SARMs from Chemyo to keep results consistent and legit.</p>

<h2>What Is SR9011?</h2>
<p><strong>SR9011</strong> is a Rev-ErbA agonist. It‚Äôs not technically a SARM, but it‚Äôs grouped with them. This compound targets your circadian rhythm‚Äîbasically how your body manages sleep, metabolism, and recovery.</p>
<p>I used <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/sr9011/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SR9011 from Chemyo</a> for 6 weeks. The results hit fast.</p>

<h3>My SR9011 Results</h3>
<p>By week 2, I noticed I was waking up earlier, sleeping deeper, and burning fat easier‚Äîeven on rest days. It felt like my metabolism was always ‚Äúon.‚Äù Cardio was way easier, and I was less sore after hard workouts.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs not for bulking. You won‚Äôt gain size. But you will <strong>lean out fast</strong>, especially when combined with a good diet.</p>

<h3>SR9011 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Accelerates fat loss</li>
  <li>Boosts endurance and recovery</li>
  <li>No suppression or PCT needed</li>
  <li>Improves sleep and energy</li>
</ul>

<h3>SR9011 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No muscle gain at all</li>
  <li>Needs dosing multiple times a day (short half-life)</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Cutting, endurance, recovery, fat burning</h4>

<h2>What Is ACP-105?</h2>
<p><strong>ACP-105</strong> is a newer SARM known for its mild nature and clean results. It‚Äôs often seen as a safer version of S4, minus the vision issues. I ran it solo for 8 weeks using <a href="https://www.chemyo.com/product/acp-105-solution/?campaign=github&ref=166" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ACP-105 from Chemyo</a>.</p>

<h3>My ACP-105 Results</h3>
<p>This is a lean muscle builder. I gained around 3‚Äì4 lbs of muscle and dropped visible body fat, all while staying dry and tight. It didn‚Äôt bloat me or crash my hormones.</p>
<p>It felt light. I recovered faster, stayed strong during workouts, and never felt suppressed. It's a good ‚Äúentry-level‚Äù SARM or a bridge between cycles.</p>

<h3>ACP-105 Pros:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Dry lean muscle gains</li>
  <li>Good strength boost</li>
  <li>Minimal to no suppression</li>
  <li>No liver stress</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACP-105 Cons:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not as strong as RAD or LGD</li>
  <li>Muscle gains are slower but cleaner</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Best for:</strong> Lean mass, cutting, recomposition</h4>
